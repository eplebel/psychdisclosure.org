One sample consisted of women who were undergraduate students at the University of British Columbia participating in the Psychology Department Subject Pool (in the paper, this sample was labeled Sample B). We began collecting data from this sample in March, 2012, and aimed to recruit women to participate through the end of the school term--April, 2012. We successfully recruited 62 women during this time (we concluded data collection when the subject pool closed at the end of the term), but could include only 24 of these individuals, due to the restrictions commonly imposed to maximize the validity of self-reported ovulation measures (all restrictions were reported in our paper). We also simultaneously (beginning in February, 2012) recruited a larger sample of women on M-Turk (labeled Sample A). Our goal for the M-Turk study was to recruit participants until we obtained a useable, regularly ovulating sample (i.e., women who met all of our inclusion criteria) of N = 100; this target number was chosen to allow us to detect a medium to large sized effect. Of note, in addition to details provided in the Online Supplement that appeared with our paper, more methodological information can be found in this blog post, which was linked to a post that appeared on Slate.com: http://ubc-emotionlab.ca/2013/07/too-good-does-not-always-mean-not-true. </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse12" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Le & Impett</td><td colspan="2">When Holding Back Helps: Suppressing Negative Emotions During Sacrifice Feels Authentic and Is Beneficial for Highly Interdependent People</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse12" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Analyses were conducted on a subset of a larger dataset on sacrifice in daily life.

The FBS, which measured explicit attitudes toward the overweight, was included for exploratory purposes. The scale (as well as the results from the scale) were not reported due to space limitations. At the end of the study we asked some basic demographic information (age, gender, and political orientation), as well as participant height and weight. These were not discussed in detail due to space limitations. On the back-end of Study 1b we included two self-report items asking subjects how satisfied they with their present body shape and how satisfied they were with their present body weight (1 = very dissatisfied, 7 = very satisfied). We did not report these items because of space limitations, and because they were highly redundant with our primary moderator of interest, which was subject's Body Mass Index (BMI was highly correlated with these items, and using the subjective satisfaction items instead of BMI yields qualitatively similar results). In Study 2 we mention that participants answered several questionnaires but did not specify these items, again due to space constraints. Subjects completed a 10-item Social Desirability scale (M-C Form 1; Strahan & Gerbasi, 1972), as well as a 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The Social Desirability scale is discussed briefly in the Supplementary Materials.

For all studies we terminated data collection before analyzing the results.</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse23" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td>Jul 2013</td><td> Pascucci,  Turatto et al.</td><td colspan="2">Immediate effect of internal reward on visual adaptation.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse23" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Data from 1 participant in Experiment 1 and from 2 participants in Experiment 2 were excluded due to performances at chance level on the orientation discrimination task.</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>The sample size was determined by the statistical analyses, and on the ground of the average sample size in other psychophysics experiment in the literature</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse24" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td> Rabagliati,  Snedeker et al.</td><td colspan="2">The truth about chickens and bats: Ambiguity avoidance distinguishes types of polysemy.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse24" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>We ran two pilot studies; both showed the same result but the design was less elegant. </li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>a) A guesstimate based on our pilot study b) When we reached our guesstimate. </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse25" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Gibson,  Piantadosi et al.</td><td colspan="2">A noisy-channel account of crosslinguistic word-order variation.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse25" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>2 participants in experiment 1 (English) was excluded for not following the instructions (only gestured the verbs); 53 trials (out of 592 trials) in experiment 1 (English) were excluded because either there was no patient gestured or the verb (action) was gestured on both sides of the patient; 12 trials (out of 263 trials) in experiment 1 (Japanese) were excluded because either there was no patient gestured or the verb (action) was gestured on both sides of the patient; 33 trials (out of 311 trials) in experiment 1 (Korean) were excluded because either there was no patient gestured or the verb (action) was gestured on both sides of the patient; 43 trials (out of 310 trials) in experiment 2 (Japanese) were excluded because either there was no patient gestured or the verb (action) was gestured on both sides of the patient; 42 trials (out of 311 trials) in experiment 2 (Korean) were excluded because either there was no patient gestured or the verb (action) was gestured on both sides of the patient; 1 participant in experiment 3 (English) was excluded for knowing ASL; 1 participant in experiment 3 (English) was excluded for not following the instructions; 11 trials (out of 341 trials) in experiment 3 (English) were excluded because either there was no patient gestured or the verb (action) was gestured on both sides of the patient.</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>We determined our sample size by estimating based on previous work using the same method: Goldin-Meadow et al.

This subject was initially turned away for failing to provide documentation of SAT scores. The subject begged to be allowed to participate because he needed the credits for satisfactory completion of his psychology course; he promised to provide documentation in the coming days. When the subject failed to follow through on this promise, the first author discarded his data without inspecting them. </li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>We administered a brief questionnaire at the end asking whether the subject had participated in any of our previous studies, whether the subject had taken the IQ tests previously, how much sleep the subject had gotten the previous night. We might have asked some other quick questions, but I cannot recall. This data has been lost. We did not include this information because (1) it contained nothing of interest (e.g., the two g groups did not differ significantly in hours slept) and (2) because of the strict space limitations. </li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>We initially decided to test 300 subjects for the main study. There was no compelling reason to settle on this sample size; a previous study that was somewhat similar (Schmiedek et al., 2007) had used a sample size of roughly 150, and we thought it would be good to improve upon that study by using a sample size twice as large. We learned that this goal would not be practically achievable, given the pace of subject recruitment. At this point we adjusted our goal and aspired to test at least 100 subjects. Again, no explicit rationale justified this choice; it just struck us a "nice" number. However, because the first author tested nearly every subject himself but lived over four hours away from the lab located at Harvard University, he was finding the attainment of this goal extremely difficult. At a certain point he moved to a new residence that was over seven hours away from the lab; 70 subjects had been tested by then. The two authors had a discussion regarding whether to continue the study; they decided to write up the paper and submit it. After writing the first draft of the paper, the authors decided that the secondary study was necessary. This was carried out at Union College -- a four-hour drive from the residence of the first author, who again tested all subjects. However, given the small sample of the secondary study, this long round trip was bearable. We decided to test eight subjects because in our experience this is enough to obtain significant within-subject effects equaling ~30 ms (in fact even one or two subjects may suffice). Because unpredictable numbers of subjects signed up for each session, we ended up with nine subjects.</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse27" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td>Jun 2013</td><td> Wilson-Mendenhall,  Barrett et al.</td><td colspan="2">Neural evidence that human emotions share core affective properties.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse27" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>We excluded 2 additional participants due to excessive head motion in the scanner (movement greater than 3mm during a functional scan), 1 additional participant who did not follow task instructions, and 3 additional participants who completed the first (behavioral) session, but who did not complete the MRI scan session.</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>We included several short self-report measures for exploratory purposes that were unrelated to testing our main hypotheses (e.g., to collect pilot data for grant applications proposing studies designed to assess individual differences using larger samples) because acquiring neuroimaging data is expensive.

We decided prior to running the study to collect data until this sample size was achieved, which we followed.

We collected a few more subjects than in those previous studies given that this study was examining the moderating effect of an additional manipulation (i.e., memory load). I completely acknowledge that this is a highly informal procedure; at the time it was unclear how best to formally determine sample size. While there are still many ambiguities in how to best determine sample size for fMRI studies, recent publications and software-releases (e.g., http://fmripower.org/) are beginning to clarify things. </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse63" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td>Dec 2012</td><td>Berntsen, Johannessen, Thomsen et al.</td><td colspan="2">Peace and War: Trajectories of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Before, During, and After Military Deployment in Afghanistan</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse63" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure (As stated in the supplementary material as well as in the paper: The reported study was part of a large survey conducted through the military.

That is, I aimed to “over-shoot” slightly so as to have high power after removing ineligible respondents.

For the US-to-India apology study, Experiment 4, there was a third condition, apology only, that was dropped. We did this because results looked stronger when only the two conditions – control and the maximally effective conciliatory act including both apology and reparations – were analyzed.</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>For Experiment 1, the study originally included, as possible moderators, measures of national attachment and glorification, egalitarianism, assessments of the morality of the event and of the group; and as possible outcomes, measures of group-based emotions. These measures were not reported because they were not relevant to the eventual theoretical point of the paper, and because some of them gave nonsignificant or inconsistent results across studies. We decided instead to focus on the most straightforward outcomes (e.g. satisfaction) and the theoretically relevant mediators of power, image and obligation. At some point in the research program we kept including these items for consistency but gave up even analyzing them (e.g., in the Study 4). For Experiment 2, the study also originally included, as possible moderators, measures of national attachment and glorification, assessments of the morality of the event and of the group; and as possible outcomes, measures of group-based emotions. Using the same rationale as in Experiment 1, these were not reported in the final manuscript. For the US-to-Bunce Island apology study, Experiment 3, the study originally included, as possible outcomes, measures of specific group-based emotions, and as a possible moderator, perceptions of the sincerity of the apology and importance of future improved relations. These were not reported in the final manuscript, again for the same rationale of exclusion used in Study 1. It also included measures of personal willingness to take part in outreach (e.g. visit Bunce Island) but these were not reported because they did not correlate well with collective action measures, had a floor effect, and did not yield significant effects of manipulations. For the US-to-India apology study, Experiment 4, the study originally included, as possible moderators, national identification, and perceptions of who is responsible, as well as specific intergroup emotions. These were not reported in the final manuscript again for the same rationale of exclusion used in Study 1. Additionally, there were measures of perceived power similar to Study 1 and 2, which were not reported because they were nonsignificant and by then not relevant to the theoretical picture, Study 4 being reported to address a specific editor’s/reviewer’s point about the interpretation of obligation shifting.</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>For Experiment 1, sample size was determined ad hoc based on availability of participants through the research participation pool (as many people as signed up were allowed to take the study). Sample size was not altered midway through based on looking at the results. For experiment 2, sample size was determined ad hoc based on availability of participants through the research participation pool (as many people as signed up were allowed to take the study). Sample size was not altered midway through based on looking at the results. For the US-to-Bunce Island apology study, Experiment 3, sample size was determined ad hoc based on availability of participants through the research participation pool (as many people as signed up were allowed to take the study). After an initial data collection yielded marginally significant results, we undertook an additional data collection, which improved the significance to conventional levels. For the US-to-India apology study of Experiment 4, sample size was determined based on availability of MTurk funds, and initially was 40 per condition minus attrition from noncompleted studies.

Results were not reported because they address different hypotheses. Studies 2 - 5:  Generally, these were studies that pursued multiple objectives. We focused reporting on relevant variables while trying to give a methodologically accurate account of procedures. In the published JPSP article we briefly allude to the fact that participants' rated their own and others' (unless a confederate) behavior and a questionnaire that assessed general reactions to the discussion (provided by William Fleeson from his original acting extraverted study).  More details are available for Study 2 & Study 3 where behavior results are reported in Zelenski, Santoro, & Whelan, D. C. (2012) (as noted in our article). Very similar behavior questionnaires were included in Studies 4 & 5. Also, we note that Studies 2-5 were conducted in the order reported. Study 2: Participants also completed a Stroop test following the group discussion (Reported in Zelenski et al., 2012). Study 3: Participants also completed a Stroop test following the interview. They also provided a drop of blood analyzed for glucose near the beginning of the study and just before the Stroop test (Reported in Zelenski et al., 2012). Study 4: Participants completed a (unreported) mood questionnaire at the beginning of the session. (This omission from the procedure section was an oversight.) After the interaction (and data reported in our JPSP paper), confederates rated participants' affect and behavior, participants completed an exploratory implicit affect measure (Quirin, Kazen and Kuhl, 2009), and participants played the game 'Operation' where we recorded time to completion and errors. However, the task was implemented with significant variation, there was missing data due to malfunctions, and errors were difficult to record accurately. Study 5: Separate from and before the experimental session, but explicitly connected with it, participants completed additional personality measures of BIS/BAS, authenticity, and ideal self. Following the group interaction (and thus data presented in the JPSP paper), participants rated their state authenticity and effort, and completed a Stroop task.  As the most recent study in the package, we anticipate reporting on some or all of these additional measures in future publications. </li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Across studies 1-4, we determined rough goals for sample sizes, but they were ultimately largely determined by how much data we could collect in a give term. If sample size was far from those goals, data collection continued to another term. Loose consideration of power and a local rule of thumb suggested that sample sizes of about 110 gave a reasonable chance of detecting moderately sized personality x situation interactions. In no case did we decide to stop or continue collecting data based on the results of analyses. As part of D. Whelan's dissertation, Study 5 included some more formal power analyses prior to data collection (with regard to hypotheses beyond those reported in JPSP, however), but pragmatic issues of recruitment within a term still played a role.  </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse140" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td>May 2013</td><td>Lucas,  Lawless et al.</td><td colspan="2">Does life seem better on a sunny day?

Subjects are seen once a year by anthropologists and physicians affiliated with the Tsimane Health and Life History Project (http://www.unm.edu/~tsimane/). We average an 85% participation rate among Tsimane adults in the villages that are part of the THLHP. The sample size of our personality interviews was not pre-determined. Our self-report sample (n=632) resulted from all adults who participated in our project during 2009 and 2010 and who agreed to take the personality questionnaire.  For the first half of 2009, our clinic was mobile and traveled to each of the 28 villages then part of the THLHP. Subsequently, our clinic was located in a fixed position and we transported Tsimane adults from those 28 villages (over 40 years of age) to our clinic on a village by village basis (in addition to their immediate family members and any other village residents reporting injury or illness).  We targeted older individuals for our fixed clinic given the larger goals of the THLHP to investigate senescence in a traditional population. Thus, most of the individuals in our self-report sample under the age of 40 were interviewed at their village in the first half of 2009. During the year 2010, we administered the personality questionnaire to any adults visiting our clinic who did not complete the questionnaire the prior year.  At that point we deemed the sample size (n=632) and representativeness of the sample in terms of age, sex, village affiliation, education, etc. to be sufficiently robust. The spouse-report sample (n=430) was obtained the same way at our fixed clinic during 2011 and 2012.  No data analysis (with respect to the principal results of the paper) was conducted prior to collection of the full datasets. </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse150" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Peetz & Wilson</td><td colspan="2">The post-birthday world: Consequences of temporal landmarks for temporal self-appraisal and motivation.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse150" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Studies 4, 5, and 6 were the earlier studies conducted.

In Study 4 and 6, we emailed a subset of potential respondents from an email list, aiming for around 25 participants per condition.

The remaining 15 cases were excluded for failing a attention check question that followed the article that comprised our threat manipulation which read "According to the article you just read, who is the primary cause of climate change? a) young people (ages 18-25), b) middle-aged people (ages 35-55), c) older people (ages 60-80), d) the primary cause of climate change is unknown."    16 participants were excluded from Study 3. Of these excluded cases, 5 were excluded for indicating that they were over 25 years old. The remaining 11 participants were excluded for failing the same attention check question used in Study 2.</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>We did not report filler questions unrelated to our research questions that were included to support our cover story. </li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>For Study 1 we ran a power analysis assuming a medium to large effect size that indicated a optimal sample size of 111 participants. We gave 6 RAs 20 questionnaires each to hand out around campus. Our RAs returned with 114 questionnaires. For Study 2 we performed a power analysis assuming a large effect size that indicated a optimal sample size of 87 participants. Although we reached this target by the end of the semester, because we had to exclude 26 cases we ended up with only 61 participants in our final analysis. For Study 3 we were shooting for at least 20 participants per cell. We stopped collecting data once we had reached 80 participants. However, because 16 cases ended up being excluded from data analysis we ended up with 64 participants.</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse179" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Shu & Gino</td><td colspan="2">Sweeping dishonesty under the rug: How unethical actions lead to forgetting of moral rules</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse179" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Full Disclosure</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse180" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td>May 2012</td><td>Briñol, McCaslin, & Petty</td><td colspan="2">Self-generated persuasion: Effects of the target and direction of arguments</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse180" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure </li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure </li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>We excluded any items that were unrelated to the research questions or that were included for exploratory purposes.

This condition did not significantly differ from the other two conditions. Upon reflection we realized that this condition was ineffective because our outcome measure asked participants to compare the amount of discrimination their group experiences to that of the outgroup. Whereas in the threat condition participants increased their rating as a function of defensive processes (as evidenced by the condition’s differentiation from the other comparison condition, and by our mediational finding), in the control condition participants may have rated the groups as equal due to non-defensive processes. We dropped the condition due to its irrelevance to the overall project and its lack of significant differentiation.</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>In Studies 2 and 4 we included items measuring the extent to which participants engaged in competitive victimhood with outgroups other than the group they were accused of harming. In one case there was an effect of condition on these items, in the other there was not. Based on these results and the results of other studies not included in this paper, it seems to be the case that the order of measurement makes the difference.

In the large majority of the studies in my lab this means we collect big-5 personality measures, optimism, self-esteem, and (in some cases) anxiety (BAI) and depression (BDI -- without the suicide question). for studies that include intergroup/inter-racial questions, we also obtain measures of intergroup contact, modern racism or social dominance orientation and race rejection sensitivity. for the paper in question, we did not examine any individual differences as moderators (other than the IAT measure in study 3). Once we have more intergroup studies completed we plan to examine how individual difference moderators influence the effects across multiple studies, but we are waiting until we have over 1000 people before we launch this type of individual difference investigation. </li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>for psychophysiology studies we tend to have an expectation based on our past studies and others studies that if the manipulation is an interracial setting, we tend to obtain effect sizes in the medium to large range (between .5 and .8, see Blascovich et al., 2001 for this range). So we decide ahead of time what our target number of participants are and then step once our random assignment sheet says we are done. I want to point out that for those of us who do neuroendocrine studies there is not an option of opportunistic stopping because we assay our data in batch (meaning all data are assayed at one time). So if there was ever a case in which something was just short of significant, for example, we don't have the option of starting back up the study. Once a study is done, it is done. </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse276" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td>May 2013</td><td>Berntsen,  Staugaard et al.</td><td colspan="2">Why am I remembering this now?

Exploration of my (ML) email archive shows that I collected data across two consecutive weekends, but it appears that I did look at the data between these sessions and decided to decline individuals volunteering for a third weekend on the basis of the data obtained from the first weekend. I don't have record of what criteria I used in making this decision, but at the time I was indeed using null-hypothesis significance testing methods and would have likely been looking for p<.05 for at least the interaction of two of the three variables manipulated in the study. The fact that I did not resume recruiting after the second weekend suggests that whatever criterion I was using held after the data from the second weekend was added. Despite our failure to define a clear stopping rule, it should be noted that while NHST methods may have been used to peek at the data during collection, the final reported analysis employs a likelihood-based evidence quantification approach for which stopping rules should be less important with regards to inference. The transition from NHST to likelihood methods was driven by my (ML) exposure to literature on the philosophical/inferential superiority of the likelihood approach over NHST (though more recently I've made yet another transition from likelihood to Bayesian methods), as well as by the fact that there is no consensus method to extract p-values from the advanced computational methods by which we accounted for the possibly-non-linear effects associated with the continuous variable manipulated in the study. We hope that if the latter barrier hadn't existed, we would have maintained our reluctance to employ NHST methods on the more important philosophical grounds.</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse279" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Nordfang, Dyrholm et al.</td><td colspan="2">Identifying bottom-up and top-down components of attentional weight by experimental analysis and computational modeling.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse279" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Sample size were determined prior to data collection based on our experience with comparable experimental setups </li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse280" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Redick, Shipstead et al.</td><td colspan="2">No evidence of intelligence improvement after working memory training: A randomized, placebo-controlled study.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse280" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Also collected but not analyzed because we had not hypotheses involving the information included: parents’ native countries, whether or not subjects were native English subjects (if not, age they learned English), subjects’ race, subjects’ handedness, a questionnaire about subjects’ videogame experience</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Full Disclosure</li></ol></div></div></td></tr><tr href="#collapse281" data-parent="#accordion2" data-toggle="collapse" class="accordion-toggle"><td><div class="accordion-heading"><i id="toggle" class="icon-plus"></i></div></td><td></td><td>Shteingart, Neiman et al. </td><td colspan="2">The role of first impression in operant learning.</td></tr><tr><td class="more"></td><td class="more"></td><td colspan="2" class="more"><div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapse281" style="height: 0px;"><div class="accordion-inner"><ol><li><strong>Exclusions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Measures: </strong>Full Disclosure</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>We re-analyzed previously-published data collected by another lab, which is now available on-line and did not do the experiments ourselves.

In both waves, all students agreed to complete the study.

Among the antecedents, four measures were included but not analyzed because of interpretive problems. There were two items intended to measure character attributions (“To what extent do you think James behaved the way he did because of something about his personality?”; “To what extent do you think James behaved the way he did because of something about who he is as a person?”) These were ambiguous as to whether they measured the more theoretically relevant construct of bad character (not all acts were judged as bad), so we excluded them from the measure, relying on the two variables that explicitly referred to “bad person” and “weak/flawed character.” There was an item assessing how much James had harmed himself, which was not relevant to the moral emotions under scrutiny (cf. Gutierrez & Giner-Sorolla, 2007). We also had a single exploratory item, “To what extent does James’ behavior violate people’s values?” This proved to show general high correlations with all the other measures and was not further explored.</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>Study 1: Determined arbitrarily as a function of recruitment into the study; stopping was determined prior to looking at the results.
