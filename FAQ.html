			<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q: Won't people just lie when providing additional information for the 
          public spreadsheet?</strong><br>
          A: We think they won't. We are confident that in spite of recent high-profile 
          cases, actual data and reporting fraud is very infrequent in psychology. 
          Much more common -- and therefore worrisome -- is the extent to which 
          post-hoc reporting decisions based on significance have become acceptable. 
          We think almost all researchers want to play by the rules of the game; 
          we just propose realigning the rules so that they conform to statistical 
          reality and common-sense ideas of honesty.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q: I'm concerned that if I report the practices we actually used, people 
          will question my research.<br></strong>
          A: Your article represents a great achievement. It has addressed an 
          interesting question and passed through a tough process of peer review. 
          We don't think supplying additional information will take that achievement 
          away from you. However, we hope you will agree that as scientists, our 
          primary commitment is to the truth -- not to any given idea, no matter 
          how personally invested we are in it. Ultimately, truth does not reside 
          in any one study, any one paper, or any one lab, but in the overall 
          body of evidence. More accurate reporting in any one article will allow 
          better assessment of this body of evidence overall.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q: What exactly is sound reporting practice?<br></strong>
          A: We have chosen to focus this project on the goal of increasing the 
          amount of information in a research report rather than defining what 
          is good and bad research. However, our basic assumption is that sound 
          practice is principled. That is, it accurately reports any ideas and 
          procedures determined a priori; if these were modified in the course 
          of the research, it reports this fact, along with the reason for doing 
          so. We are not seeking to impose standards that further restrict how 
          people can run studies or analyze their data. We are encouraging standards 
          under which people can feel free to report honestly what they did and 
          why.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q: If I don't respond, will my research be judged as dishonest?</strong><br>
          A: Because only 50% of the authors in your journal and issue have been 
          randomly chosen to take part, there will be no way of identifying you 
          if you choose not to participate. Information regarding who was and 
          was not contacted will be kept strictly confidential as research data. 
          Using this selection approach, we are emphasizing the positive benefits 
          of adding information to your article, rather than the negative judgment 
          of not doing so.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q: Which journals are being targeted and why?</strong><br>
          A: We are focusing on articles published in all 2012 issues (and onward) 
          of <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em>Psychological Science</em>, <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition</em>, and <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em> 
          because they represent prominent journals in psychology that are widely 
          read. However, our effort may eventually expand to other psychology 
          journals and other publication years.</p>
			<br>
          <strong>Q: Can I submit disclosure information for articles not covered by your initiative?</strong><br>
          A: Yes! Please see <a href="contactus.html">Contact Us</a> page for details on how
		  to e-mail us your information.</p>
		  <br>
          <strong>Q: Won't journals or editors be upset because some of the disclosures will involve information on how the 
		  reviewing process itself sometimes leads to selective reporting?</strong><br>
          A: Yes it is possible that disclosures revealing questionable editorial practices (QEPs) might irk some journals given that 
		  these practices have now been identified as clearly inadmissible or indefensible. However,
		  we view this possibility as a small cost compared to the much larger benefit that disclosing this information will have for improving research practices in our field</p>
		  <br>
          <strong>Q: But why is an independent group of researchers requesting this information? Shouldn't journals be asking for this information?</strong><br>
          A: We can't agree more that it is indeed the journals that **SHOULD** be asking for this information rather than an independent group of researchers!!! 
		  (Trust me, I'd definitely rather be doing science than spending hundreds of hours e-mailing hundreds of corresponding authors!!!). The fact of that matter is, 
		  however, that journals are **NOT** 
		  asking for this information at this time. As a (bottom-up) strategy to move us closer to this reality, our initiative aims to raise awareness regarding our 
		  journals' completely ineffective reporting standards with the hope that our website inspires journal editors to consider changing editorial policies whereby the 4 
		  categories of methodological details disclosed on this website become a required component of submitted manuscripts. Indeed, there is evidence that our
		  website is already having such an effect.</p>
		  <br>
          <strong>Q: I've been randomly selected to disclose the methodological information and I support your cause, but isn't unfair because 
			opponents in our intense theoretical debate can now use this information about minor procedural imperfections to advance their cause?</strong><br>
          A: We sympathize with this concern, however, we believe that it is completely scientifically justified to then turn around and
		  email your opponents requesting such methodological details (not required to be disclosed) for papers containing findings implicated in the debate! 
		  This is not only fair, but completely scientifically reasonable given that it is crucial to know these methodological details to accurately interpret 
		  the reported published findings. </p>
